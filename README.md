# Docker Book

## About this book

Hi there! I'm Chetan Jain. Pleased to make your acquaintance. We'll be spending some time together, as I'm supposed to teach you a tad bit about In this Crash Course on Docker I will teach you just as you can comfortably use it for Development purposes while keeping your sanity. 

But enough about me, what about you? I'm hoping that you're at least a bit familiar with basic Programming and Linux/Unix skills and familiar with the command line.

This book focuses on Docker, one of the most popular containerization platforms used in the software industry. Docker allows developers to package applications and their dependencies into portable containers, making it easier to deploy and run applications across different environments. I believe Docker is an essential skill to learn for today's developers for the following reasons

 * **Simplified Deployment**

    Docker allows you to package an application along with its dependencies into a standardized container, making it easy to deploy and run consistently across different environments. This simplifies the deployment process and reduces the chances of compatibility issues.

 * **Scalability and Portability**

    Docker enables efficient scaling of applications by allowing you to spin up multiple instances of containers on demand. It also provides portability, allowing you to run containers on any platform that supports Docker, regardless of the underlying infrastructure.

 * **Isolation and Resource Efficiency**
    Docker provides a high level of isolation between containers, ensuring that applications run independently without interfering with each other. It also optimizes resource utilization by allowing you to run multiple containers on a single host, making efficient use of system resources
