## What Next
Docker is an excellent tool, but deploying applications solely using Docker is not enough. To handle container deployment, failure recovery, log management, and obtaining SSL certificates from Let's Encrypt, you need to utilize additional technologies.

## Kubernetes vs Docker Swarm

Between 2016 and 2017, a significant competition emerged among Docker Swarm, Mesosphere DCOS, and Kubernetes to become the de-facto container orchestrator where Kubernetes emerged as the victor. 

While it is worth noting that Docker Swarm and other container orchestrators continue to exist, their progress and market presence is small in comparison to Kubernetes.

So, as per wisdom of crowd I highly recommend you to learn Kubernetes.
